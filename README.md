# A study in RecyclerView

This project is an exploration of things that one can do with the RecyclerView. 

Here are some great resources on learning about RecyclerView.
- [Caster.IO course on RecyclerView](https://caster.io/courses/recycler-view)
- [Adding click listeners](https://antonioleiva.com/recyclerview-listener/)

These great tutorials cover the specifics of how to get drag and drop, and
swipe to dismiss working with RecyclerViews.

These resources are great for best practices for naming things in Android 
(which were used to name the multitude of layout assets in this project).
